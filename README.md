# WikiEngine

WikiSearch Engine A robust, high-efficiency search engine implementation capable of indexing and querying Wikipedia dumps. Built entirely in C++ without external search libraries, this project demonstrates advanced data structure engineering.

## Core Architecture:

- Indexing: Custom Inverted Index handling millions of tokens.

- Ranking: Hybrid ranking algorithm combining TF-IDF (content relevance) and PageRank (link authority).

- Autocomplete: Optimized Trie (Prefix Tree) structure providing real-time query suggestions.

- Performance: Optimized for low-latency queries and memory-efficient storage.
